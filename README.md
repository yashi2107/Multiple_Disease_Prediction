# Multiple_Disease_Prediction
 
A multiple disease prediction system for diabetes and heart disease using Streamlit is a web application that utilizes machine learning models to predict the likelihood of an individual having either diabetes or heart disease based on various input features such as demographic information, medical history, lifestyle factors, and clinical measurements.
Here's how such a system typically works:

Input Gathering: The user interacts with the Streamlit web application by providing relevant information such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, body mass index (BMI), family history of diseases, exercise habits, etc. These inputs are collected through user-friendly interface elements like text inputs, sliders, dropdown menus, etc.

Feature Processing: The input data provided by the user may need to be preprocessed to ensure it matches the format expected by the machine learning models. This preprocessing step may involve tasks like data normalization, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Model Prediction: Once the input data is processed, it is fed into pre-trained machine learning models that have been developed to predict the likelihood of diabetes and heart disease based on historical data. These models use algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines, or deep learning techniques to make predictions.

Result Presentation: The predictions generated by the models are then presented back to the user through the Streamlit interface. This could be in the form of a binary classification (e.g., "high risk" or "low risk") or a probability score indicating the likelihood of having each disease.

Interactive Features: Streamlit allows for the creation of interactive elements in the web application, so users may have the option to adjust input values dynamically and see how it affects the predicted outcomes in real-time. This can help users gain insights into the factors contributing to their risk of disease.

Overall, a multiple disease prediction system for diabetes and heart disease using Streamlit provides a user-friendly platform for individuals to assess their risk of developing these conditions and make informed decisions about their health.
